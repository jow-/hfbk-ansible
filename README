# Ansible for LEDE/OpenWrt

Before a device can be used with ansible configuration management,
it needs to be added to the inventory first.

In order to add a device to the inventory, use the enroll-device.sh
script which will execute a specialized playbook to turn a vanilla
LEDE/OpenWrt installation into a managed wireless access point.

Before starting with the enrollment, ensure that the installed
firmware has the following packages installed:

 - openssh-sftp-server
 - python


## Enroll device

Connect one of the devices LAN ports to your local workstation and
ensure that your workstations ethernet interface is set to ip address
192.168.1.2, netmask 255.255.255.0.

Also make sure that your workstation has access to the management VLAN
in order to regain access to the provisioned unit once it completed
its base network setup.

One way to achive this is running a tagged + untagged VLAN trunk from
the central switch to the workstations eth0 and attaching the to-be
enrolled unit into another tagged + untagged trunk switch port.

Assuming that the management network uses VLAN 10 and provides a DHCP
server, use the following commands to prepare the environment:

  ip link add eth0.10 link eth0 type vlan id 10
  ip link set up dev eth0
  ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0
  dhclient eth0.10

After verifying that both eth0 and ath0.10 have their address ranges
configured, the actual enrollment process can be started.

Execute the ./enroll-device.sh script in order to pick up the
unconfigured LEDE/OpenWrt device at eth0/192.168.1.1 and wait until
the steps are completed.

If the playbook finished successfully, a device information file
will be placed into the hosts/ directory, using the DHCPv4 IP address
as file name.


## Configure device

In order to roll out a list of wireless settings onto all enrolled
devices, use the ./configure-devices.sh script after adjusting the
network parameters in the "configure.yaml" toplevel playbook.


## ToDO

 - Add SSH key management and password setting
 - Disable unused services
 - Develop a hostname generation schema
 - Gather more device info like /tmp/sysinfo/ ids
 - Move config parameters from playbook into external variable files
